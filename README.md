The growing complexity of embedded systems and IoT applications demands high-performance, energy-efficient, and versatile hardware platforms. This paper presents Chipsetron, a custom-designed VLSI microcontroller built around a proprietary 32-bit processor core tailored for modern automation, robotics, and edge computing environments. Chipsetron integrates advanced architectural features, including a pipelined RISC core, an embedded GPU for parallel data processing, and a comprehensive interrupt management system with Non-Maskable Interrupt (NMI) support for real-time fault handling. It offers extensive peripheral connectivity, including 32 GPIOs, UART, SPI, I2C, eight PWM channels, a 10-channel 12-bit ADC, and a DAC for analog output. Emphasizing both computational power and system resilience, Chipsetron supports seamless interaction with sensors, actuators, and communication modules. The chip is designed to operate efficiently in power-sensitive environments while offering scalability for both prototyping and deployment. Simulation-based validation confirms its performance and responsiveness, positioning Chipsetron as a robust platform for intelligent embedded applications in domains such as smart infrastructure, environmental monitoring, and autonomous systems.
